# Programming-Technique-I

In Programming Technique I or PTI, I learn that PTI is about the logic, strategy, and approach that a programmer employs to quickly and independently build a program. The programmer can create a program that can do a certain series of computations in a short amount of time, make logical conclusions, and repeat a set of instructions without error.
